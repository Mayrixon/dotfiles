# Deploy

- `Dotter` is used for zshrc only (experiment)
  - Because of lacking of folder symlink, `dotter` is only used for single-file configs now
- `Stow` is used for other packages

# TODOs

- [ ] Enable autocompletion in zshrc
- [ ] Add autocompletion command of `gh` into init.sh
- [ ] Add dotter's local settings template
- [ ] Change zsh plugin manager. The original manager zinit was deleted by the
  author.
